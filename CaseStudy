You work as a Devops Architect in Zendriix Softwares. The company has been struggling to
manage their product releases. The releases should happen on 25th of every month. Suggest a
Git Workflow Architecture for this requirement.

Simulate this workflow, by creating a pseudo code files and branches, and upload the same to
your GitHub Account.
As a part of solution, share the link to your GitHub repository.

Solution:

1. Create master branch with original code files.
2. each developer will create a branch to be able to make their changes.
3. Each developer will commit and push their changes to their branch in the repository.
4. Merge reqeusts will be taken care of by another individual - maybe the team lead.
5. In the case of a merge conflict, the conflict will be resolved by the team lead via the user interface on GitHub.
